A small collection of scripts I wrote to help a class of third and fourth graders
create videos from their drawings during their "Totoro and Friends" project week.

The workflow is
* get jpegs into a directory
* run to-png.bash
* run create-img-list.bash
* open index.html 
* use QuickTime to create a screen recording while navigating with left/right/Esc
